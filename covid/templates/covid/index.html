                <h3>Understanding the charts</h3>
                <p>Each chart shows new daily cases on a rolling 7-day average. 
                Y-axis is new cases and x-axis is days, starting when a location 
                reaches 30 new cases in a day. </p>
                <p>Counties are on the same scale as each other and states are on the 
                same scale as each other.</p><p>The dashed line represents data from the 
                last 14 days. Some locations (my state of Georgia included) backdate cases 
                to an estimated "infected date", meaning that the most recent 14 days are 
                unreliable. The end result is that the last 14 days almost always show a 
                downward trend. I don't know how many other locations do the same thing, 
                so the dashed line may or may not be reliable.</p>
                <p>The charts are color coded along a simplified version 
                of <a href="http://www.asymco.com/">Horace Dediu</a>'s categorization:</p>
                <blockquote><p>Green: Late Stage (&gt;50% post-peak)<br>
                Blue: Middle-Late Stage (~50% post-peak)<br>
                Orange: Middle-Early Stage (peaked)<br>
                Pink: Early Stage [or indeterminate] (pre-peak)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>My simplified application means that often indeterminate stages are 
                mis-categorized. If a location doesn't have a clear peak yet, it is 
                probably Early/Indeterminate, regardless of the color.</p><p>I didn't 
                feel like futzing with a database server for this, so all the data is 
                handled locally. Apologies for the page load hit. The data should refresh 
                when stale, but if you think your data is incorrect, you can force a 
                refresh with the "Refresh data" button located at the bottom of the page.</p>
                <p>I wish I could've normalized the data with cases per capita, but the 
                data source doesn't have population data.</p>

                <h3>About this app</h3>
                <p>This app was borne out of my desire to both see how the Coronavirus 
                pandemic is faring in locations I care about, seeing that in as narrow a 
                location as possible, and having some kind of objective markers for when 
                things are "ok". I found great value in 
                the <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/coronavirus-georgia-covid-dashboard/jvoLBozRtBSVSNQDDAuZxH/#main">AJC's 
                Coronavirus Dashboard</a>, 
                the <a href="https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-19-daily-status-report">Georgia 
                Department of Health's COVID 19 Daily Report</a>, 
                and <a href="https://twitter.com/asymco/">Horace Dediu's periodic chart releases</a>. 
                I would check the AJC and GA DPH daily and would often anticipate an update from 
                Horace's analysis.</p><p>The data is from 
                the <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">NY Times dataset</a>, which 
                has US, State, and, importantly, County data.</p>
